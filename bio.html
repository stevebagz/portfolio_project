            <p>I'm a father, musician, and hobby gamer.  I have worn many hats throughout my career.  After a stint in the sales
                and service industry, I chose to pursue a trade to satisfy a desire to use my mind to design solutions, 
                troubleshoot issues, as well as working in constantly changing environments using my hands. This was something I
                considered a "weak point" within myself, having not been exposed to much work involving tools or physical savvy.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon acceptance to college, I completed my diploma in the Electro-Mechanical Technician program offered at 
                Nova Scotia Community College.  After completing my 2 year program, I worked for Graybar Canada, beginning in 
                their warehouse and later being promoted to a position in sales.  I was able to use this job as a networking 
                opportunity, and finally moved into working in the trades as a Construction Electrician.  I spent over 4 years
                doing electrical work, and became hungry to do work that was a bit more technical and required more problem
                solving.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Once again, through networking, an opportunity had presented itself with a local communications company, 
                Seaside Communications (now owned by Rogers).  I began learning this new trade by completing in home 
                installations of TV, internet, and telephone for customers. As I gained experience, I was relied on as a 
                service technician, solving problems for customers with existing services.  After a few years (and a lot of
                extra work and questioning my co-workers), I was placed in a temporary position as a construction and 
                maintenance technician.  This position required me to learn a whole new side of our system, building larger
                distribution circuits that are tapped into by customers, as well as troubleshooting issues and outages as they
                occurred.  After approximately one year of this, I had accepted these new duties as my full time position.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, another evolution has occurred.  I've become more fascinated and passionate about creation and 
                problem solving, and was introduced to web development by a close friend.  In August 2023, I began introducing
                myself to the Python language, and after a few months of practice and some consultation, decided to take this 
                journey more seriously and enroll in an online program with Codecademy.  I've been studying the Front-End 
                Engineer program since October 2023, and upon completion, plan to continue studying and practicing in hopes of
                obtaining work as a developer.
