            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>Listed below are some of the <span>projects</span> I have worked on independently parallel to my journey with 
                <span>Codecademy</span>.  I am currently enrolled in the <span>Front-End Engineer</span> program.  So far, I 
                have found the course to be <span>incredibly</span> helpful. It has its moments of feeling "easy", as well as 
                moments of great challenge (I'm looking at you, <span>JavaScript</span>).  With study and repetition, concepts
                become <span>clearer</span>, and ideas become easier to implement.  Although the content on these pages remain 
                unfinished, the <span>goal</span> I wanted to achieve was <span>proving to myself</span> that I could not only
                learn, but use the new material I'd learned in a <span>practical</span> fashion.  I will list my work in 
                chronological order, and hopefully you can use this list as a window to peer into my <span>evolution</span>
                as a developer.

                - My first website!  This is rough, but I'm still proud of it.  A very coarse mixture of HTML and CSS; I didn't 
                know what a nav bar was, and the idea of creating a border around items was super cool to me.  Having a fun 
                background, and being able to navigate between pages within a site was a massive step.  This site is a fun 
                keepsake for me, and reminds me of how much you can progress with some hard work!
            </li>
            <li><span><a href="https://stevebagz.github.io/shitfactory/" target="blank">The Sh*t Factory</a></span> - Immature as
            it may be, this was a major practice run for me! I learned how to make a fixed nav bar, practice with flexbox,
            organize my divs in a logical manner, align/center content, add images, and most importantly, make a page that
            fully responsive, from PC, to tablet, to various small mobile devices.  This was an open ended Codecademy assignment,
            and although it is very silly and immature, its development was taken very seriously.  This page intends to 
            show off its ability to be responsive and comfortable rather than "good looking", and is a step above its 
            predecessor.
            </li>
            <li><span><a href="https://stevebagz.github.io/RetroGameClub/" target="blank">Retro Game Club</a></span> - This was
            a fun little site to build as I have a passion for Retro Gaming.  Yet another Codecademy assignment, this page is 
            fully responsive.  I had fun importing fonts that looked relevant to the page, and practiced using background 
            images for some of my divs, laying text over top of them.  I build a small testimonials section for the bottom, 
            and experimented with different style borders for my nav bar and footer.  Once again, a few notches above my last 
            project, taking any chance I could find to add a little more "shine".
